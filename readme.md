# Setup

No pypi packages are required to run the program. You can simply clone the repository and run the `PromoCert.py`. Currently the program will accept any combo of two arguments of name then rank to be promoted to. The name needs to include the previous rank.

## Todo
- Add stolen valor disclaimer in the form of "MILSIM based off of 3MRB on ARMA Reforger"
- Auto-detect previous rank if new rank isn't given
- Auto copy final image to user clipboard for quick use
- Reduce number of temporary files unless in debug mode
